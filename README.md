This project represents a comprehensive opportunity to apply and reinforce a broad array of critical concepts in object-oriented programming and C++,
making it an invaluable part of your learning journey. By designing a class hierarchy with a base Product class and specialized Smartphone and Laptop derivatives, 
you will engage deeply with the principles of generalization and specialization, learning to minimize code duplication through effective use of inheritance. Furthermore, 
the requirement to implement polymorphic behavior not only through interfaces and virtual functions but also via templates, allows you to explore the power and flexibility of
C++ in crafting reusable code components. Such experiences are crucial in developing a solid understanding of object-oriented design and the specific mechanisms C++ offers to solve
complex programming challenges.

Beyond the core object-oriented principles, this project also pushes you to work with raw pointers and dynamic memory management, critical areas in C++ programming that require 
careful attention and skill. Handling an inventory of products dynamically adjusts to changing requirements, offering a practical scenario to apply these concepts. Moreover, by 
requiring the implementation of functionalities like adding and removing items, displaying items by category, and calculating the total inventory value, you gain hands-on experience
with designing member functions that solve tasks of linear complexity and use stream objects for input/output operations.
